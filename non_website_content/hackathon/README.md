This section contains information that may be useful for running a hackathon

For example, for introduction to open source and using git a script could consist of:


Who has used github before?
Yes - then lets assigned you an issue now, and you can get started. Let us know if any questions
      Go through the issues and assign those who want to just get started.
No - then we need to get you set up with an SSH key in Rstudio so that Rstudio & Github can talk together

Follow the document in CAMIS/non_website_content/hackathon/  folder to set things up.

Ensure you have started a New Project in R studio - pointing to the CAMIS repo.

Show them that they can:
1) Fork any repo -- clones the folder -- branch the repo, edit in R studio & push.
   Submit a pull request for your work to be included.
or
2) Give us your user name, we will add you as a CAMIS contributor, which gives you additional rights
   We add you to the project, then you can assign yourself to issues
   You can then create a branch from the main branch in R studio - do edits & push back.
   You can also edit directly in github and submit a pull request (PR)
    
Reminder re: Main branch, or your branch: Pull down before doing changes each time to minimize conflicts.
Do edits & push back, then you have to go into R studio to complete the PR.

Go through issues & assign to people

Any issues they can share their screen and we can help them.
