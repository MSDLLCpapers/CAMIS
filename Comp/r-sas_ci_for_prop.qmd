## Introduction

There are several ways to calculate a confidence interval (CI) for a proportion. You need to select the method based on if you have a 1 sample proportion (1 proportion calculated from 1 group of subjects), or if you have 2 samples and you want a CI for the difference in the 2 proportions. The difference in proportion can come from either 2 independent samples (different subjects in each of the 2 groups), or can be matched (the same subject with 1 result in 1 group and 1 result in the other group [paired data]).

The method selected is also dependent on whether your proportion is close to 0 or 1 (or near to the 0.5 midpoint), and your sample size.

For more technical derivation and reasons for use for each of the methods listed below, see the corresponding [SAS page](https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/SAS/ci_for_prop.html).

## General Comparison Table For Single Sample Proportions

The following table provides an overview of the results comparing between R and SAS for Single Sample Proportions and independent 2 sample proportions . See the corresponding [SAS page](https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/SAS/ci_for_prop.html) and [R page](https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/R/ci_for_prop.html) for results showing a single set of data run through both SAS and R.
